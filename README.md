This is Project Zero on the journey to learning web development!

This demo was written after going through W3Schools HTML and CSS sections. As such, its purpose was to practice various interesting aspects of HTML and CSS that I found interesting, and so I purposely avoided using any JavaScript. Specific details on what I did can be found in the comments.

Here are concepts new to me that I attempted to implement:

- Mobile-first design: When making websites in the past, I've always designed them to work on desktop since I'm the only one who uses it, and I rarely use mobile. So this is the first design that I've taken the mobile-first approach, which is design it first with mobile screens in mind, and adapt for larger screens afterwards.
- CSS reset
- Linear gradients
- Math calculations (calc and min) in CSS
- Flexbox
- Transitions, including those on hover, and the differences in using display, visibility, and opacity properties to hide and show elements
- Up and down arrows using CSS borders and rotation
- Multiple transforms
- Animations
